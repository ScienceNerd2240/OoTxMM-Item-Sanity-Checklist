# OoTxMM-Item-Sanity-Checklist (Rework)
***THIS IS HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL***

### Currently Supported Sanities
- Pot-sanity
- Grass-sanity

(Cows, Scrubs, Shops and GS are often provided by other trackers. The two above however are a lot more placed around the world)


## Instructions
1. Open the [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hYNdVLx3_e04TXS3mhLATXmRIRqXx3XnPLwl4uQFvAE/edit?usp=sharing)
2. Make a copy and save it
3. Enjoy your randomizer



### For Suggestions:

Submit a PR containing a link to your copy of the spreadsheet with the suggested changes highlighted and/or commented on. You can also suggest in the OoTMM randomizer discord, a link can be found on the website generator for the randomizer.

### For Issues:

While you can report issues here, the preferred method is to ask directly in the discord if it is rather urgent
