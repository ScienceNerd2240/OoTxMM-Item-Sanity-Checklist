# OoTxMM-Item-Sanity-Checklist
Place for suggestions



Instructions for use:
1. Open the link
2. Make a copy of the spreadsheet
3. Enjoy your seed

For Suggestions:
Submit a PR containing a link to your copy of the spreadsheet with the suggested changes highlighted and/or commented on. You can also suggest in the OoTMM randomizer discord, a link can be found on the website generator for the randomizer.

For Issues:
While you can report issues here, the preferred method is to ask directly in the discord, as I may not always be readily available to help with in-the-moment needs (I have to sleep sometimes lol)
